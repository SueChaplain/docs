You can define a team in a GitHub repository that will have authority to administer a collection using the Kabanero CLI.

In a public GitHub repository or a repository in GitHub Enterprise within your organization:

. On the Home page of your git organization, click *Teams*.
. Click the *New Team* button.
. On the *Create New Team* page:
* Enter the name of the team.
* Optionally, provide a description.
* Accept the defaults for the remaining choices.
* Click the *Create team* button.

. On the next panel, click the *Add a member to the team* button.
. Type the username for the person that you want to add to the team and click *Enter*.
. Repeat the previous two steps for each person that you want to add to the team.
