Application developers code and optimize microservice applications by using application stacks. By using these stacks,
developers donâ€™t need to manage the full software development stack or be experts on underlying container technologies or Kubernetes.
In a few easy steps, developers can install the tools that enable them to develop with application stacks and then focus on doing what they do best, writing application code.

## Installing  developer tools

As an application developer, you can start working with development projects in a number of ways. You can
either use the command line in a terminal window, a local IDE such as Eclipse or VS Code, or CodeReady
workspaces for a containerized development environment. Choose from one of the following guides to get started:

- [Developing microservice applications with the CLI](https://kabanero.io/guides/use-appsody-cli/)
- [Getting Started with Codewind and VS Code](../../../../guide/codewind-getting-started-vscode/)
- [Getting Started with Codewind and Eclipse](../../../../guide/codewind-getting-started-eclipse/)

##  Getting started with development projects

When you are ready to start coding, learn about developing microservices from different application stacks in
the following guides:

- [Developing cloud native microservice applications with the Open Liberty application stack](../guides/stack-java-openliberty/)
- [Developing cloud native microservice applications with the Spring boot application stack](../guides/stack-springboot2/)
- [Developing cloud native microservice applications with the Node.js application stack](../guides/stack-nodejs/)
- [Developing cloud native microservice applications with the Node.js Express application stack](../guides/stack-nodejs-express/)
