A sample script to uninstall Kabanero Foundation is available in the *kabanero-operator* GitHub repository. Before running the `uninstall.sh` script,
consider removing any resources that were not created by the `install.sh` script, such as webhooks, Knative services, or Appsody applications.

The sample script completely removes all dependencies from the cluster, including Knative, Tekton, and OpenShift Service Mesh.
If you want to keep some of these dependencies, modify your local copy.

Follow these steps:

. Obtain the `uninstall.sh` script for the release of Kabanero that you want to uninstall by running the following command:
+
----
curl -s -O -L https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator/releases/download/<version>/uninstall.sh
----
Where `<version>` is the 3-digit Kabanero version number.
. As a user with `cluster-admin` privileges, run the script:
+
----
./uninstall.sh
----
