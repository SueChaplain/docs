= Governing stacks with semantic versioning tags

When customizing stacks, architects and operations personnel can implement link:https://semver.org[semantic versioning] tags as part of a
governance policy that ensures that only the precise, desired application stacks are used for application builds and deployments. This strategy
is made possible by the fact that container registries can be labeled with one or more tag values, which can change over time, while the
container identifier (also known as the "digest") is immutable.

== Semantic versioning

In semantic versioning, versions are limited to 3 digits: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Changes to:

- PATCH indicates the container contains only fixes that are backwards compatible.
- MINOR indicates the container contains new features that are backwards compatible.
- MAJOR indicates the container contains versions of features and software that could introduce deprecations or withdrawal of features, and
that might not be backwards compatible.

**Note:** There are special rules if the MAJOR level of the version is 0 or if the PATCH level is suffixed with non-numeric characters. For
more detail, see link:https://semver.org[semver.org].

By adhering to semantic versioning, you can take advantage of the governance policy described here. There is, however, no requirement to follow
a particular tagging policy.

== Examples of semantic versioning in application stack tagging

In the following examples of using tags to facilitate a semantic versioning governance policy, these tags are used:

- `latest`: Mutable. Assign this tag to the same container as latest PATCH level of the latest MINOR release of the latest MAJOR release.
- `MAJOR`: Mutable. Assign this tag to the latest PATCH level of the latest MINOR release of this major release.
- `MAJOR.MINOR`: Mutable. Assign this tag to the latest PATCH level of this minor release.
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: Immutable. Assign this tag to the specific container that is built providing the specific patch level.

=== Initial level and patch level

In this example, the first release of a container, which has digest number 767h34, is assigned the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH level of `1.0.0`,
a MAJOR.MINOR tag of `1.0`, a MAJOR tag of `1`, and the `latest` tag. A patch of the container is then released, which has digest number
9485jd, and is given the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tag `1.0.1`. The MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tags are immutable and are not used to tag another
container digest. The other tags (`latest`, `1`, and `1.0`) are moved to the new release. A query of the container registry
for tags `latest`, `1`, `1.0`, and `1.0.1` now return digest 9485jd.

=== New minor release

In this example, a new MINOR version has been published. The latest and MAJOR tags are reassigned to the `1.1.0`
container, and a new MAJOR.MINOR (`1.1`) tag is added to the new container. Notice that the existing `1.0` tag remains
assigned to 1.0.1 container.

=== New major release

For this example, a new MAJOR version is published. The `latest` tag is reassigned to the `2.0.0` container, and new MAJOR (`2`)
and MAJOR.MINOR (`2.0`) tags are also assigned to the container.

=== New patch released

In this example, a new patch level is released for version 2.0.0. The `latest`, MAJOR, and MAJOR.MINOR tags are
assigned to the 2.0.1 container.

image::/docs/img/digest-2.0.1.gif[link="/docs/img/digest-2.0.1.gif" alt="New patch release"]

=== Another major released

Another new MAJOR version is published in this example. The `latest` tag is reassigned to the 3.0.0 container, and new
MAJOR (`3`) and MAJOR.MINOR (`3.0`) tags are also assigned to the container.

=== New patch for prior release

In this example, the new container advances the PATCH level of 1.1, and that PATCH is the latest semver release of MAJOR
version 1. Therefore, both the MAJOR (`1`) and MAJOR.MINOR (`1.1`) tags are reassigned to the 1.1.1 container.
Even though this container was published last chronologically, the `latest` tag remains with the latest PATCH level of
the latest MAJOR.MINOR release.

== Application stack tagging for governance

There are advantages to using only the MAJOR.MINOR tag to identify the application stack version in the stack hub. This value,
stored in the `.appsody-config.yaml` file, declares that this application is only dependent on the feature set that is introduced
and provided by the application stack at the MAJOR.MINOR level, and not on any specific PATCH level. When using the MAJOR.MINOR tag
you can therefore be assured that the latest released PATCH level is used.

When an application stack patch level is ready to be introduced to developers, be sure that it is activated before any events are
triggered to build or to deploy applications built on the new patch level.

When publishing a new patch level of an application stack container:

1. Build the new application stack container and tag the container with its desired 3-digit semver tag (e.g., `0.2.23`).
2. Update the desired deployments with the new single stack index to activate the new stack.
3. Move the existing tags `latest`, MAJOR and MAJOR.MINOR to the new patch container (i.e., 0.2.23).
4. Rebuild the stack-hub index shared with developers to include the latest patch level.
5. Build pipelines label application containers, which identify the three-digit semantic version application stack that is used to
build the application. Query your container registry for containers that are built with the older patch level.
6. For each container, rebuild, test, and redeploy the applications on the older patch level.

When retiring an older patch level of an application stack container:

1. Rebuild, test and redeploy all relevant applications built on the older patch level.
2. Remove application containers built on older patch level from the container registry.
3. Remove the old index from the stack hub index shared with developers.
4. Deactivate the older patch level of application (be sure to refresh and synchronize also).
5. Remove the old patch level of the application stack container from the container registry.


== Compliance detection

During the lifecycle of applications and during normal operation, container digests are examined to validate compliance with the semantic versioning
best practices. Based on the configuration policy in place, different actions will occur at those decision points.

- **pre-build**: Before build pipeline tasks run, there is a check to ensure that the base application stack that the application is being built with is
activated.

- **post-build**: Even though a container digest was confirmed to be active prior to build, it is possible that in the interim the container tag was
reassigned to a container with a different digest.

////
- **pre-deploy**: Before deploying an application, the labels of the underlying base application stack are examined for matches with active application stacks.

- **ad-hoc**: Using the CLI and REST APIs (via Kabanero Unique Experience), the active application stacks version container digests are queried to see if
they are the same as when the stack was activated. The operator will store the digest of a given application stack version when it is first activated and
update the status field of the Stack CR with that digest value.
////

== Governance actions

The actions taken at the decision points depend on the governance policy chosen. Policy is set within the Kabanero CR using the new field
`governancePolicy`, which has a subfield `stackPolicy`. The stackPolicy subfield can have the following settings:

  * `strictDigest`: Indicates that usage of container tags for application stacks follow strict guidelines, and noncompliance will result in a
  failure to proceed at the lifecycle point of detection. PATCH tags are not expected to be assigned to different containers. This policy is for
  use by teams that have rigid container tagging policy and activation procedures.

  * `activeDigest`: (DEFAULT) Indicates that usage of container tags for application stacks follow the tagging best practices. During a "pre-build"
  stackPolicy enforcement point, a digest mismatch results in the substitution of a tag from a compatible active PATCH level within the same MAJOR.MINOR.
  This policy ensures that only application stacks that are activated are used to build applications. It also allows for a more flexible process for
  updating the container registry tags.

    During a "pre-build" stackPolicy enforcement point, when the `.appsody-config.yaml` file specifies:
      ** :MAJOR. The Kabanero operator will use the latest active PATCH level of the latest MINOR release with the same MAJOR. If there are no PATCH levels
      active for any MINOR releases of the specified MAJOR level, the build fails.
      ** :MAJOR.MINOR. The Kabanero operator will use the latest active PATCH level of the specified MAJOR.MINOR. If there are no PATCH levels active for
      the specified MAJOR.MINOR release, the build fails.
      ** :MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The Kabanero operator will use the specified stack, if active. If the specified PATCH level is not active, the build fails.

During a "post-build" stackPolicy enforcement point, the version must be specified as active in the `.appsody-config.yaml` file, because the
application has already been built at that specific level. If the version is no longer active, as determined by the digest, the post-build
stackPolicy enforcement fails.

////
    The behavior at a "pre-deploy" point is also the same: the application image has already been built and the stack
    version, by digest, must be active.
////

  * `ignoreDigest`: Application stacks are still governed but using tags only. There is still a check that a valid matching PATCH level is active
    at the governance detection points. Digests are not considered when making governance decisions.

This policy is useful for teams that do not have strict tagging policy for their containers, or have adopted a tagging policy that makes governance based on digests unnecessary.

  * `none`: Disables any stack active state, tag or digest validation. Pipelines will be allowed to progress without any stack governance.

=== Governance policy action examples

The following examples of policy enforcement are based on a prepopulated container registry for a given application and activated stack state,
as shown in these images:

For life-cycle detection points after post-build, the application is built on a specific 3-digit container. Application stacks are
labeled with a dev.appsody.stack.version label which indicates the stack build level. (Note: issue
https://github.com/appsody/appsody/issues/957 was opened to improve the ability to manage governance policy for container digests during
deployment; the current suggestion is to add a new label: dev.appsody.stack.digest to application containers.)
