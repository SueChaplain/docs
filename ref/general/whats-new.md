title: What's New In Kabanero 0.7.0
---

The next monthly release of Kabanero, version 0.7.0, is here now! This terrific project keeps getting better.

New stuff includes: a UI testing framework and some initial tests; new admin features that allow you to manage your admin teams in GitHub via the Console UI (requires OAuth); and support for a new way to lay out the GitHub spec in the Kabanero Custom Resource. We've also generalized tool creation on the UI to reduce repetitive code. If you plan to author a new guide, note the updated authoring instructions as we've consolidated them into a single repository.

Check out all the details on what’s new in our [What’s New in 0.7.0 blog post](/blog/2020/03/20/WhatsNew070.html).
