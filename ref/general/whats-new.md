title: What's New In Kabanero v0.6.0
---

Today we present the next monthly release of Kabanero, v0.6.0. A lot has changed since the last release!

Kabanero uses stacks now instead of collections. Head over to the docs section to read up on how that changes everything.

We've added more functionality to the manage stacks section. Using the UI, you now can sync your stacks with the Kabanero CRD, deactivate stacks, and view the CLI service version.

You'll now see a tile for CodeReady Workspaces, if it's installed.

Other updates include: a cleaner UI for the Instance page, an integration testing framework, security updates, a Liberty dev mode for easier development, and (of course) many bug fixes.
