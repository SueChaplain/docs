title: What's New In Kabanero 0.6.0
---

Today we present the next monthly release of Kabanero, version 0.6.0. A lot has changed since the last release!

Kabanero now uses stacks instead of collections. Accordingly, instead of collection hubs, you have normal Appsody stack hubs. This fundamental and pervasive change simplifies and improves configurability.

We've added more functionality to the manage stacks section. Using the UI, you now can sync your stacks with the Kabanero CRD, deactivate stacks, and view the CLI service version.

You'll now see a tile for CodeReady Workspaces, if it's installed.

Other updates include: a cleaner UI for the Instance page, an integration testing framework, security updates (including an application-supporting single sign-on server), a Liberty dev mode for easier development, updates to the trigger configuration, and (of course) many bug fixes.

Check out all the details on what’s new in our [What’s New in 0.6.0 blog post](/blog/2020/02/27/WhatsNew060.html).
