title: What's New In Kabanero 0.7.0
---

The next monthly release of Kabanero, version 0.7.0, is here now! This terrific project keeps getting better.

The console has new admin features that allow you to manage your GitHub admin teams via the Console UI (requires OAuth). The console also supports the new way to lay out the stack hub spec in the Kabanero Custom Resource, this allows you to still see your stack hub URLs via the Console UI. We've also generalized tool creation on the UI to reduce repetitive code, and added a UI testing framework with some initial tests to ensure quality code. We've added the Open Liberty operator and a guide about developing for the Open Liberty stack. Speaking of guides, if you plan to author a new one, see the updated authoring instructions as we've consolidated the guide source files into a single repository.

Check out all the details on what’s new in our [What’s New in 0.7.0 blog post](/blog/2020/03/20/WhatsNew070.html).
