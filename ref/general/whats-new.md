title: What's New In Kabanero v0.3.0
---

Today you can get your hands on the next monthly release of Kabanero, v0.3.0. Weâ€™ve been working hard in the kitchen to cook up some new features and bug fixes in this month's release.

One focus area for this release is shifting our deployment platform from OKD 3.11 to OCP 4.2. This shift from OKD to OCP is only temporary because OKD has not released 4.x version yet. Some new updates in this release include: a hosted IDE with Eclipse Che and Eclipse Codewind, adding Red Hat ServiceMesh and Serverless features, security updates in Collections 0.3.0, and more. Check out all the details on what's new in our [What's New in 0.3.0 blog post](/blog/2019/11/21/WhatsNew030.html).
