title: What's New In Kabanero 0.8.0
---

Kabanero version 0.8.0 is now available! We have implemented some exciting new changes.

In this release we've enabled a governance policy that will ensure that only the active application stacks are being used to build microservices, and that the microservices being deployed are built from those same active application stacks. [Reference documentation](/docs/ref/general/reference/semver-governance.html) on how to take advantage of this is provided.

In pipelines, you can now make TLS enabled calls to SKOPEO.

For more information about these and other updates, see the [Whatâ€™s New in 0.8.0 blog post](/blog/2020/04/17/WhatsNew080.html).
